addlama - for always understanding, making me feel comfortable, being so unique and fun to talk to ! For spending so long teaching me strategies in depth. 

jae - for being one of the person I looked up to the most for so many years, your music is something that will always stay with me, 
your streams are always fun to watch, we share so many similar stories about life and I know that one day we'll both be okay, you deserve it so much Jae! 

jojoe - for being the nicest person I know, for always helping me no matter how dumb my issue is, I don't think I can even realize how much time you spent 
just to help me. I hope we can play more pubg together soon 

megeli - for being my best friend, for being the person that will always reply at any time, no matter what, for always taking my defense even when I fuck up,
for all the energy we put into this stupid game, I'm proud of us bestie ! 

moki - for being someone who completely changed my life and helped me understand that I could be anything I want to be, maybe one of the most important 
person I've ever met. 

tj - for being such a big inspiration for me, one of my friend and one of my favorite artist at the same time, introduced me to the keyboard world, 
recommended me so many great songs, I'm glad to have you somewhere! 

wakes - for being there, over the years, always supportive. We met in such a stupid way on a Trackmania server cus i was obsessed about drain gang back 
then and idk, We've had bunch of disagreement, I've been an idiot for so long but you've always had the patience to help, you're like a big brother to me ! ! 

And so many other people that I look up to a lot. And all the other person that I probably forgot. Thank you everyone ! ! 

Edit 5/29/23 -  I think about adding some other people on here, I just haven't done it yet, im a lazy person . . . 
Really grateful to have pamba, meebie and cawzmik in my life though, you guys help a lot :]
